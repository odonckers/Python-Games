Python-Games
============
A place where you can see my work and give me pointers on what I could do better with Python.

PaddleBall
----------
In this game you control the Blue Paddle. Your objective is to keep the Orange Ball from hitting the bottom of the screen, and every time the Blue Paddle is hit with the Orange Ball, you get points. But if the Orange Ball hits the bottom of the screen, "Game Over" for you!

StickStory
----------
In this game you control the Stickman. Your objective is to get the Stickman to the door at the top left of the screen. But, if you notice in the top left corner there should be a "Points: 5000". Now there is also a Pink Ball Eraser, and every time he hits one of the platforms, you lose a random number of points (But never more than 750 Points). And, well, you guessed it, if your Points hit 0, "Game Over" for you!
